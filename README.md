What is it:

<br>-creative contest platform - “creativity as a sport”</br>
<b>-or, draftkings for creative contests</b>
 
Why:

-Gamify creativity and learning
-Crowdsource original creative content from anywhere
-help people improve their skills through competition
-I’m motivated to “do” when there is group accountability and constraints - I want to be motivated to learn all the time, and I want to compete to improve myself with others so that we can contribute in bigger and better ways to society, because that is the most meaningful format of life, for me.

Inspiration:

“his grandma has a heart attack while driving, grandson is in the passenger seat. Grandson quickly grabs the wheel and turns car into safe area. tells police he learned how to do that from mario kart.”
